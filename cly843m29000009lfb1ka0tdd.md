# Introduction

This technical article is about the creation of a bash script named create\_users.sh designed to automate user and group management on a Linux system. This script is part of the DevOps Stage 1 task for the [HNG Internship](Https://hng.tech/internship). It reads a text file (user\_lists.txt) with employee usernames and their respective groups, creates the users and groups, sets up home directories with appropriate permissions and ownership, generates random passwords for the users, and logs all actions. The script also securely stores the generated passwords.

### Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of bash scripting.
    
* Root access to a Linux system.
    
* Git installed on your system.
    
* A remote Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
    

### Step 1: Creating the Input File

First, you need an input file that lists the users and their associated groups. Create a file named `users.txt` with this format:

```basic
ronke; sudo,dev,admin
charity; sudo
mosh; designer,admin
```

### Step 2: Writing the Bash Script

Next, you write a bash script named `create_`[`users.sh`](http://users.sh) to automate the user and group management tasks.

```basic
#!/bin/bash

set -x  # Enable debugging output

# Check if the script is run as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Please run as root"
  exit 1
fi

# Define the input file and log files
INPUT_FILE="users.txt"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/user_management.log"
PASSWORD_FILE="/var/secure/user_passwords.txt"

# Ensure /var/secure directory exists
mkdir -p /var/secure
chmod 700 /var/secure

# Clear previous log entries
> "$LOG_FILE"

# Function to generate a random password
generate_password() {
  local password_length=12
  tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c $password_length
}

# Read the input file line by line
while IFS=';' read -r username groups; do
  # Remove leading and trailing whitespaces
  username=$(echo "$username" | xargs)
  groups=$(echo "$groups" | xargs)

  # Create user and personal group
  if id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
    echo "User $username already exists. Skipping..." | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
  else
    # Create the user with a home directory
    useradd -m "$username" -s /bin/bash
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "Created user $username" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"

      # Create personal group with the same name as the username
      usermod -aG "$username" "$username"

      # Set the home directory permissions
      chmod 700 /home/"$username"
      chown "$username":"$username" /home/"$username"

      # Generate a random password
      password=$(generate_password)
      echo "$username:$password" | chpasswd

      # Store the password securely
      echo "$username:$password" >> "$PASSWORD_FILE"
      chmod 600 "$PASSWORD_FILE"

      echo "Password for $username stored securely" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
    else
      echo "Failed to create user $username" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
      continue
    fi
  fi

  # Create and add groups to the user
  IFS=',' read -r -a group_array <<< "$groups"
  for group in "${group_array[@]}"; do
    group=$(echo "$group" | xargs) # Remove leading and trailing whitespaces
    if [ -n "$group" ]; then
      if ! getent group "$group" &>/dev/null; then
        groupadd "$group"
        echo "Created group $group" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
      fi
      usermod -aG "$group" "$username"
      echo "Added $username to group $group" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
    fi
  done

done < "$INPUT_FILE"

echo "User creation process completed." | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
```

### Step 3: Making the Script Executable

You can make the script executable by running the following:

```basic
chmod +x create_users.sh
```

### Step 4: Running the Script

You can only run the script with root permissions:

```basic
sudo ./create_users.sh
```

### Step 5: Adding the Script to a Remote Repository

**Initialize a Git Repository**: `git init`

**Add the Script**: `git add create_`[`users.sh`](http://users.sh)

**Commit the Changes**: `git commit -m "commit message"`

**Add the Remote Repository**: `git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>`

**You can then push the Changes**: `git push origin main`

### Step 6: Testing the Script

* Create a test environment by setting up a virtual machine and ensure you have root access.
    
* Prepare the Input File: The `users.txt` file
    

```basic
ronke; sudo,dev,admin
charity; sudo
mosh; designer,admin
```

You have to make sure that the `create_`[`users.sh`](http://users.sh) script is in the same directory as `users.txt`

* Run the Script:
    

```basic
sudo ./create_users.sh
```

* Check if the users were created:
    

```basic
getent passwd ronke charity mosh
```

* Verify the groups each user belongs to:
    

```basic
groups ronke charity mosh
```

* Confirm the home directories were created with the correct permissions:
    

```basic
ls -ld /home/ronke /home/charity /home/mosh
```

* Check the log file for actions performed by the script:
    

```basic
cat /var/log/user_management.log
```

* Ensure passwords are stored securely:
    

```basic
sudo cat /var/secure/user_passwords.txt
```

### **Conclusion**

This script allows SysOps engineers to efficiently manage employees' usernames and group names, ensuring security and consistency.
