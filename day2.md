### What is a Linux command?

**A Linux command** can be defined as a text-based instruction or request entered into a Linux terminal or command-line interface to perform specific tasks or operations on a Linux-based operating system. A Linux command is a simple way to tell your computer what to do. These commands are used to interact with the Linux system, manage files and directories, configure system settings, and perform various administrative and utility functions. Linux commands typically have a specific syntax and structure. They consist of a command name followed by optional parameters or options that modify the command's behavior.

Linux commands are typically written in text and executed in a terminal window. A terminal window is a black-and-white window where you can type commands and see the results.

**The Linux command used to check your present directory:**

**pwd** - Print Working Directory: The pwd command is the most simple way to display the current working directory. When you run pwd, it will display the full path of the directory you are currently in.

**The Linux command used to List all the files or directories, including hidden files:**

**ls -a :** The ls -a command, when you run it, will display the names of all files and directories, including hidden ones, in the current directory.

 **The Linux command used to create a nested directory A/B/C/D/E:**

**mkdir -p A/B/C/D/E** is used to create a nested directory in Linux. The -p option will create any necessary directories if they still need to be created.

In conclusion, Linux commands are a powerful way to do many things with the computer. By learning the basic Linux commands, you will be able to navigate the filesystem, create and manage files and directories, view the contents of files, search for files and directories, and learn more about other Linux commands.
