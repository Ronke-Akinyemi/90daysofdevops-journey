* Why is DevOps important?
    

# **What is DevOps?**

DevOps is a way to develop and deliver software faster and more reliably. It does this by combining software development and IT operations into a single process. This process means that developers and operations teams work together throughout the development process to ensure that software is released quickly and with high quality.

DevOps is a mindset, culture, and set of technical practices that support the integration, automation, and collaboration needed to develop and operate a solution effectively.

### **Automation**

DevOps automation uses software to automate tasks in the software development process. This process includes tasks such as code integration, testing, deployment, release, and monitoring. Automation improves the quality and reliability of software, reduces manual errors and frees up team members to focus on more strategic work.

### **Scaling**

Scaling in DevOps is the process of expanding and shrinking your systems and practices as you need them. Scaling involves designing and implementing systems that can handle increased load and traffic.

### **Infrastructure**

Infrastructure in DevOps is the practice of using automation tools and technologies to provision, manage, and deploy infrastructure resources such as servers, storage, and networking. Infrastructure involves the hardware and software resources needed to run applications and services. Infrastructure involves the hardware and software resources needed to run applications and services.

# **Why is DevOps important?**

DevOps is important because it is a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing development.
